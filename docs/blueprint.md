# **App Name**: WasteWise AI

## Core Features:

- Homepage: Homepage displaying information about the WasteWise AI and its capabilities.
- Image Upload and Preview: Component for users to upload waste images. Preview the selected image before submission.
- ML Inference API: API endpoint that connects to a Python ML model to classify waste, estimate quantity/manpower, and returns a JSON response.
- Dashboard UI: Display the waste type, quantity, manpower required, and other details (recyclable, decomposition time).
- Waste Distribution and Report Export: Generate a summary dashboard with visual representations using chart views to display the waste distribution. Export a PDF report summarizing the analysis.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Green (#4CAF50) to represent environmental friendliness.
- Secondary color: Light Gray (#F5F5F5) for backgrounds and content separation.
- Accent: Orange (#FF9800) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clean and readable typography optimized for data presentation.
- Use clear and intuitive icons for waste types and dashboard elements.
- Responsive layout with a clean and structured dashboard design.
- Subtle transitions and animations for feedback during image upload and data loading.

## Original User Request:
Prompt for AI App Builders (Lovable AI / Bolt AI)
Build a full-stack web application for Smart Waste Management using React, Tailwind CSS, a Python-based ML API, and Firebase or Node.js backend.

also Make sure that image reconization is accurate so that Waste type is classified accurately

ðŸ§  App Description:
Create a minimal, content-rich web app that allows users to upload an image of waste. Once uploaded, the image should be analyzed by an integrated Machine Learning model which classifies the waste and returns key details:

Type of Waste (e.g., Organic, Plastic, Metal, E-Waste,glass)

Estimated Quantity (Light, Medium, Heavy)

Required Manpower to clean it

Useful Info (e.g., recycling value, decomposition time)

The output from the ML model should be displayed in a responsive dashboard UI, showing:

Summary cards with the ML results

Visual charts (like pie/bar) to show the distribution

Clean layout using Tailwind CSS

Optional: export or print report button

ðŸ”§ Functional Requirements:
Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)

Homepage with brief info about the system

File upload component (for images)

Image preview after selection

Dashboard with:

Waste Type

Quantity

Manpower

Other details

Optional: Download as PDF button

Optional: Chart view

Backend/API

API endpoint to receive uploaded image

Connect to a Python-based ML model that:

Classifies image into waste type

Estimates quantity and manpower

Returns a JSON object with all results

Respond to the frontend with this info

ML Model (Python - Flask or FastAPI)

Pre-trained or custom-trained model to:

Detect and classify waste from an image

Return structured data like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"waste_type": "Plastic",
"quantity": "Heavy",
"manpower_required": 4,
"details": {
"recyclable": true,
"decomposition_time": "500 years"
}
}
Accept image as input (either base64 or uploaded file)

Cloud Storage

Upload image to Firebase Storage or Cloudinary

Use the stored URL for ML inference

âœ… Output Expectations:
Fully functional web app

Clean frontend UI with Tailwind

Python API integrated with ML model

Image upload + response display

Responsive design for mobile and desktop
